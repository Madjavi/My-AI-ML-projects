In this project Adaptive thresholding is employed using the OpenCV library to apply small regional calculation to an image.

the goal is to study how adaptive thresholding automatically calculates or adjust the shadow and lighting at a grayscale. Two adaptive thresholding techniques have been employed in the project; 

1. Adaptive_Thresh_Mean_C, which calculates the threshold by taking the mean of the pixel values in the neighborhood area. 2. Adaptive_Thresh_Gaussian_C, which calculates the threshold by taking the weighted sum of the pixel values in the neighborhood area which uses the gaussian window technique.
