Module 6: Critical Thinking

The instruction are as follows:

Option #1: Naive Bayes Classifier

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes Prediction & accuracy
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes Prediction & accuracy
3. Posterior probability by converting the dataset into a frequency table.
4. Likelihood table w/ relevant probabilities
5. Probability errors correction w/ Laplacian correction
6. Quit

Enter Option: 


Just select one of the options to perform one of the functions per the assignment istructions.

NOTE: This is a simple  Naive Bayes classifier that uses the load_brest_cancer dataset from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
