As described in preview update documents provided throughout the class, the algorithm has been developed in a simplistic manner providing all the 
described functionality without convoluted processes. Furthermore, this algorithm is straightforward to use. 

Instructions are provided as part of the selection process and included in this note file.


The Instructions goes as follows:

1. Information & Instructions - Briefly describe how the model works.
2. View Candidates Data - Provide a list of the candidates' data before conversion.
3. Generate Candidates Dataset - Creates a CSV dataset to convert into a tensor.
4. Generate a Tensor Dataset - Creates a tensor dataset from the CSV dataset. 
5. Train the TensorFlow Model - Pass the tensor dataset to train the model.
6. Generate and view plot graph - Generates an accuracy/loss plot graph.
7. Generate Prediction Results - Generates the candidates' prediction results.
8. Quit - Exit the model.

All the interaction is accomplished by answering yes or no and selecting one of the options ranging from 1 to 8.

NOTE: The model is pre-trained, you will notice at the beginning of the execution, but by selecting option number 5, the model gets re-trained; the model can be trained many times over.
NOTE2: There two python files "Expert Front end" and "NN_Engine", just run the "Expert Front_end", the "NN_Engine" is the back-end and has been imported as a libraty.

Have Fun and Enjoy!
